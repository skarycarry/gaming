Baldurs Gate 3 is a fantastic game. It feels like the truest distillation of an RPG which makes sense as its based on DnD. But the degree of similarity is truly incredible. The major way this comes through is the use of the environment in combat. There are synergies to be harnessed for your advantage at almost any time. An enemy in water? Use electricity. No water? Conjure some. Explosives around? Lure enemies around them and set them off. An edge? Push an enemy off of it. A cheese method is to use these explosives to defeat bosses easily. The combat system interacts perfectly with the equipable items. The equipables enhance your abilities in the direction of your build and allow for some truly wild abilities by the end of the game. The story is engaging and the characters are deep. Some of my favorite quests were ones that were done to help an ally. The scenery is beautiful throughout the game however moving around the game can kind of be boring as it is entirely point and click for moving which can make it so you arent watching your character as they move. Dealing with your party can also sometimes be annoying as you traverse through the world, sometimes characters get stuck somewhere and you have to go back to get them which can cause some issues if you accidentally end up in a battle without knowing you were down a party member. Dealing with traps can also be annoying as your party members dont always move in ways that make sense and it can be tedious to go through and move each of them individually through a trap field. While the choices you make may not change the shape of the river that is the story, you can cut your own path through it using the skills you develop during the game. It truly feels like there is no overarching superpowered meta which allows for a massive amount of flexibility both in combat and out of it. Overall, this is exactly the kind of RPG you think of as old school, but updated for the modern age impeccably
