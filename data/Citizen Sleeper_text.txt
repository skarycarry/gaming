Citizen Sleeper is a text based choice adventure where you get to develop a personality for a "Sleeper", a synthetic being posessing the consciousness of a sleeping human that is employed as slave labor in a world where AI is not allowed to posess a physical body. You escape from servitude and end up on The Eye, a circular space station comprised of thousands with varying environments. It is on you to find your way in this new and strange world where you are presented with several moral decisions and have to grapple with the outcome of those decisions. This deals with descrimination against you as a sleeper, corporate greed, refugee crises, rogue AIs, and more. It is a fantastic foray into what it means to be a being and what morality is comprised of packaged as a set of choices determined by RNG dice rolls which determine your ability to perform actions. This is constantly tied to your needs as a being as your condition and energy are tied to the outcomes of your decisions and require input for you to continue to act, and also determine how many die you roll. It is a fantastic balance of resource management as well with the player having to prioritize certain actions over others. The one major downside I would contend is that your choices can feel like they dont matter at times and like the game is telling you the story it wants to tell rather than allowing you the freedom to decide where the story goes. This may not be true, but some of the answers feel as if they are packaged to lead to the same outcome rather than giving you a choice between outcomes. Can you betray someone trying to bring down a corporation to that corporation for your own gain? Can you let refugees die even though you have the means to save them? I feel the answer is no but it may require more interrogation.
