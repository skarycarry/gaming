Ghost of Tsushima is a generic open world RPG packaged beautifully. The combat is somewhat repetitive and generic with specific enemy types being beaten by certain stances, thus making enemy identification and quick stance switching crucial. While this is fun for a bit, it does get repetitive once youve mastered the skill of switching. The game also has some combat systems that I believe are above average, namely the alert system. Enemies are incentivized to be isolated, and the game allows this by only having the alarm raised by enemies who use horns, which can be negated if enemies are eliminated quickly and quietly. Other than that, the combat is not super challenging on the Hard setting (there is an extra hard setting that kills you with a single hit, but that seems ridiculous). Generic battles consist of lots of enemies coming at you, usually one on one but occasionally a second enemy will take a swipe at you. One on one duels are generally not difficult as they are usually with enemies found elsewhere in the game. While these enemies can kill you a few times, I figured it out with relatively few deaths. The setting of the game, however, is something else entirely. I dont know if I have ever seen a game that really makes you feel imersed in an environment in a playful and complete way. The flowers fall, the wheat fields stretch on, and the vines in the forest feel like they creep over you. Again, it is a beautiful game with some rather bland systems thrown in
